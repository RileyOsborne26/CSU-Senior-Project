Library of choice for OCR: pytesseract
command to get pytesseract executable path:
    "which pytesseract"

Script name:
    "tesseract_ocrAIv2.py"

Pip commands needed for requirements:
    pip install numpy
    pip install opencv-python
    sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr

I do not believe these are required but I would recommend just in case:
    sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx
    sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config
